# ForvoAPI-VocabBuilder

This is a python script made to download mp3s from a list of Japanese words using the ForvoAPI.

It takes a .txt file as an input, and reads each new line in that .txt file as
a new word to grab the mp3 for.

The primary reason for making this was to improve the usefulness of my Anki deck,
allowing me to learn the correct pronunciation for words whilst picking up
new vocabulary.

I'm quite new to python and programming in general, so if you spot anything that
could be written better / any bugs, please let me know or feel free to make
modifications.

Thanks, Ollie.
